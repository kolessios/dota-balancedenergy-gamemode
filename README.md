Balanced Energy
==

Balanced Energy is a game mode for [Dota 2](http://www.dota2.com/play/) that adjusts items, heroes and abilities to get a balanced, friendly match with a shorter duration. The supports have more impact on the match; the tanks are durable but not immortal; the most powerful carrys have been nerfed to adapt to the level of their team. 

The goal is to achieve a perfect balance between supports, tanks and carrys where all that matters to victory is the level of skill and cooperation.
